# AxoFeedback
The following repo includes all the codes involved in creating a feedback loop between the ankle exoskeleton, EMG muscle sensors and the muscles.

The feedback loop connectivity requires the following software/firmware versions:

-DELSYS Trigno Base Station Version: MA2909

-MATLAB version: R2021b (tcp/ip commands do not work after this updates)

   Would need to update MATLAB code to tcpclient and tcpserver.
   Needs the Signal processing toolbox for MATLAB.
    
-Realterm

-Arduino IDE (1.8.19 or later)
