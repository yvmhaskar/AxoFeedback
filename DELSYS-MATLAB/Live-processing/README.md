Open live_stream_processing_3.m follow the commentation and run the file.

Ensure that you first generate a MaxVolContraction file (Using the GenerateMaxVolContraction) for the testing or include an earlier 6 sensored MaxVolContraction file from the MATLAB data. This file should be present in the Live-processing folder before starting the trials.
